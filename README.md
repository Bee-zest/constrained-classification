# Learning Algorithms for Classification with Complex Losses and Constraints 

This repository contains code for the paper:

Narasimhan., H. "Learning with Complex Loss Functions and Constraints", In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2018


## Description
We provide code for two families of constrained classification problems, under complex loss functions and constraints:
- **COCO**: **Co**nvex Loss under **Co**nvex Constraints
- **FRACO**:  **Fra**ctional Convex Loss under **Co**nvex Constraints


## Usage
```
pip install dist/complex_performance_metrics-1.0.tar.gz
```
