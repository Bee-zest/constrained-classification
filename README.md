# Learning Algorithms for Classification with Complex Losses and Constraints 
======================

This repository contains code for the paper:

Narasimhan., H. "Learning with Complex Loss Functions and Constraints", In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2018

## Description
We provide code for two families of constrained classification problems, under complex loss functions and constraints:
- **COCO**: **Co**nvex Loss under **Co**nvex Constraints
- **FRACO**:  **Fra**ctional Convex Loss under **Co**nvex Constraints
